# Kalman Filter in Python

This is a basic example of how Kalman filter works in Python. I do plan on refactoring and expanding this repo in the future. 

A great series on Kalman Filters which I have been following can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIQJaqYVtuE). The example I'm using can also be found in the same video.
